### üîÑ **MAJOR SYSTEM REDESIGN IN PROGRESS**
The system is being redesigned to use a unified dancer-studio application model where:
1. **Dancers register individually** and get admin approval
2. **Studios register separately** and get admin approval  
3. **Dancers apply to studios** they want to join
4. **Studios accept/reject** dancer applications
5. **Only approved dancers** can participate in competitions
6. **Two-tier approval**: Admin approval for dancers + Studio approval for affiliation

This creates a more flexible, scalable system that properly models real-world dance studio relationships.
