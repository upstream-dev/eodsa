# 🎯 Scoring System Migration Guide

## Overview

The judging system has been updated from a **3-criteria system** to a **5-criteria system** with percentage-based rankings.

### Old System (3 Criteria)
- **Technique**: 1-10 points
- **Artistry**: 1-10 points  
- **Presentation**: 1-10 points
- **Total**: 30 points per judge

### New System (5 Criteria)
- **Technique**: 0-20 points
- **Musicality**: 0-20 points
- **Performance**: 0-20 points
- **Styling**: 0-20 points
- **Overall Impression**: 0-20 points
- **Total**: 100 points per judge

## Ranking System

Performances are now ranked by percentage with achievement levels:

- **Bronze**: ≤69%
- **Silver**: 70-74%
- **Silver Plus**: 75-79%
- **Gold**: 80-84%
- **Legend**: 85-89% (Gold medal with Legend emblem)
- **Opus**: 90-94% (Gold medal with Opus emblem)
- **Elite**: 95%+ (Gold medal with Elite emblem)

## Database Migration Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The database schema has changed and requires migration.

### Option 1: Automatic Migration (Recommended)

The system will automatically detect and migrate the database when you restart the application. Existing scores will be converted:

- Old scores (1-10) → New scores (2-20) by multiplying by 2
- Artistic Score → Musical Score
- Overall Score → Performance Score  
- Styling Score → Default value of 10
- Overall Impression → Calculated average

### Option 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer to run the migration manually:

```bash
# Run the migration script
node scripts/migrate-scoring.js
```

### Option 3: Fresh Start

If you want to start with a clean database:

```bash
# This will clear all existing data and create new schema
npm run dev
# Then visit the admin panel and use "Clean Database" option
```
